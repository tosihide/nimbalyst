# Android Package (Native Android App)

This package contains the native Android app for Nimbalyst. It mirrors the iOS native app architecture where practical: a pure native mobile shell with a single embedded web transcript view that renders the shared React transcript bundle.

## Overview

The Android app is:

- **Pure native Android** using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose
- **Room-backed** for local persistence
- **WebSocket-synced** with CollabV3 Durable Objects
- **End-to-end encrypted** using the same seed + user-derived key model as iOS
- **Transcript-rendered** through a single `WebView` that loads the bundled React transcript UI

Voice agent features are intentionally out of scope for Android.

## Key Architecture Rules

### Transcript

- The transcript UI lives in `src/transcript/main.tsx` and is bundled into Android assets.
- `TranscriptWebView.kt` is the Android host. `TranscriptBridge.kt` is the only place JS bridge actions should be decoded and routed.
- Keep transcript behavior aligned with iOS unless Android-specific UX requires a different path.

### Sync and Encryption

- `SyncManager.kt` owns the device sync lifecycle, room joins, index updates, queued prompt handling, and session control messages.
- `CryptoManager.kt` must remain wire-compatible with iOS and desktop. Be cautious with any PBKDF2, AES-GCM, or payload format changes.
- User routing identity and crypto identity are distinct. Do not collapse them back into a single field.

### Persistence

- Room is the source of truth for local Android UI state.
- Prefer repository/DAO changes over screen-local state duplication.
- If you add persisted fields, update schema, migrations, and any seed/demo paths together.

### Firebase / Notifications

- `app/google-services.json` is local environment config. Do **not** commit it. The `google-services` Gradle plugin is applied conditionally (only when the file exists), so a build without it stays green and push stays inert.
- Client push registration lives in `notifications/NotificationManager.kt`.
- Server push delivery lives in the collab server, which is the sibling `nimbalyst-collab` repository, not this monorepo. Clone it next to this repo at `../nimbalyst-collab` (override with `COLLAB_SERVER_PATH`); collab tests are gated by `RUN_COLLAB_TESTS=1`. See `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Android push changes usually require coordinated client + server work.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Ladybug / AGP-compatible version for this project
- JDK 17 for Gradle builds. The project targets `JavaVersion.VERSION_17` and `jvmTarget = "17"`, and Temurin 17 matches CI. A non-17 JDK (e.g. GraalVM) can fail the AGP `jlink` step.
- Android SDK + emulator tooling
- Node.js 20+ for transcript bundle builds

### Commands

From the repository root the npm scripts wrap the Gradle tasks:

```bash
npm run android:build:transcript    # build the transcript bundle
npm run android:test:unit           # ./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
npm run android:assemble:debug      # ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
npm run android:assemble:release    # ./gradlew :app:assembleRelease
```

To invoke Gradle directly, point `JAVA_HOME` at a Temurin 17 install (no hard-coded user path):

```bash
cd packages/android
JAVA_HOME=/path/to/temurin-17 ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
JAVA_HOME=/path/to/temurin-17 ./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
```

### Builds, signing, and CI

- The `google-services` plugin is applied only when `app/google-services.json` is present, so a build without it succeeds and push stays inert until the file is added.
- The release `signingConfig` reads the keystore path and credentials from environment variables: `NIMBALYST_ANDROID_KEYSTORE`, `NIMBALYST_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `NIMBALYST_ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`, `NIMBALYST_ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`. When the keystore is absent the release build is simply unsigned. Minification stays off (signed is not the same as minified).
- CI builds the APK via `.github/workflows/android-build.yml`, which supplies the keystore and signing secrets to produce a signed release artifact.

Open `packages/android/` in Android Studio, not the repo root.

## Agent Guidance

- Read the root `CLAUDE.md` before changing this package.
- Prefer following iOS behavior and naming when implementing cross-platform mobile features.
- Do not commit secrets or local machine config such as:
  - `app/google-services.json`
  - `local.properties`
  - build outputs
- If Android Studio reports AGP incompatibility, the correct fix is usually to update Android Studio rather than downgrade AGP/Kotlin.
- When changing sync protocol behavior, inspect the matching iOS code paths in this repo and the collab server code paths in the sibling `nimbalyst-collab` repository before editing.
- When changing transcript bridge behavior, update or add Android tests in `app/src/test/` where possible.
