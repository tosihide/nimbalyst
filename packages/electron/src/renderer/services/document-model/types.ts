/**
 * Types for the DocumentModel layer.
 *
 * DocumentModel is a coordination layer that sits between the file system

 * - Last-persisted content
 * - Dirty flag (OR of all attached editors)
 * - Single autosave timer
 * - File-watcher event handling
 * - Diff state (pending AI edits)
 * - Save deduplication
 *
 * Each editor still owns its live in-memory working copy, undo/redo history,
 * scroll position, selection, and parsed state.
