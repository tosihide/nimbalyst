/**
 * AntigravityToolLoopProtocol (backend module, main-process safe).
 *
 * Stateful multi-turn conversation manager for the antigravity-gemini-agent
 * provider. Moved here from src/AntigravityToolLoopProtocol.ts (renderer-side)
 * because the backend module owns the protocol now -- the renderer-side keeps
 * only the settings panel.
 *
 * Tool calls are surfaced through structured JSON embedded in the model's
 * response, since GetModelResponse has no native function-calling surface.
 * The parser is deliberately tolerant to formatting variation, but the four
 * decepticon-verified hardenings below close attack/parse paths previously
 * exploitable.
 *
 * Hardenings applied (phase-5-security-requirements.md):
 *   (a) Tool-name allowlist before executeToolCall. The tool loop refuses to
 *       dispatch any name that the host didn't register for this session.
 *   (b) String-aware brace matching in parseToolCall. Quoted '{' / '}' inside
 *       JSON string values no longer corrupt depth tracking.
 *   (c) Non-greedy multi-line regex in stripToolCallJson. The greedy
 *       `[\s\S]*?` was already partial; explicitly non-greedy plus an upper
 *       bound on width prevents catastrophic backtracking on malformed input.
 *   (d) Sanitize tool results before history.push. A malicious or malformed
 *       tool that returns text containing a `"tool_call"` envelope would
 *       otherwise be re-parsed as the assistant's NEXT turn intent on the
 *       following iteration. Tool results are wrapped in <tool-output> tags
 *       and stripped of the envelope token to break that vector.
